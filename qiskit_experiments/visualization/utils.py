class DataExtentCalculator:
    """A class to handle computing the extent of two-dimensional data.

    This class makes computing the extent of two-dimensional data easier, especially for
    adding images to plots where the extent of the axes (i.e., axis limits) are not
    known prior to figure generation. An instance of this class can be used to compute
    an extent tuple which is larger than the registered data, and thus has a margin that
    can exceed the axis-limits or be used as the axis limits without cropping additional
    data-points from a figure. An extent tuple ``(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)`` contains
    the minimum and maximum values for the X and Y dimensions.

    Data is registered with a :class:`DataExtentCalculator` so that the computed extent
    covers all values in the data array. The extent tuple is computed as follows:

    1. The maximum and minimum values for input data is stored whenever new data
       arrays are registered. This is the data-extent: the minimum-area bounding box
       that contains all registered data.
    2. The data-extent is enlarged/shrunk by scaling its width and height by
       :attr:`multiplier`.
    3. If :attr:`aspect_ratio` is not ``None``, the scaled extent tuple is extended
       in one of the dimensions so that the output extent tuple is larger and the
       target aspect ratio is achieved.
